   5-Creating Variables and Printing

       For you to do:
       Create a String variable "name" and assign a value of "Chen" to it
       Create an integer variable "age" and assign a value of 50 to it
       Create an integer variable "iq" and assign the value of age to it (do NOT use ' = 50')
       Print the value of a name
       Print the value of "age" and the value of "iq" on the same line.

       Output:
       Chen
       5050

   6-For you to do:

         Create a variable and assign the value of "John" to it.

   9-For you to do:
     Create a float data type variable and assign a value of  8.2 to it
     Multiply the value by itself and print the result.

     Output:
     The multiplication of ___ value with itself is equal to ___

   10-For you do to:
      1. Declare 2 numbers and assign values 200 and 100 respectively.
      2. First, add numbers, then subtract, third multiply, forth divide.
      3. Please use variables to print the values of each operation result on a separate line.

      Output:
      300
      100
      20000
      2
