Java this Keyword

The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.
The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between
class attributes and parameters with the same name
(because a class attribute is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter).

this can also be used to:

Invoke current class constructor
Invoke current class method
Return the current class object
Pass an argument in the method call
Pass an argument in the constructor call

Using this with a Constructor
From within a constructor, you can also use the this keyword to call another constructor in the same class.
Doing so is called an explicit constructor invocation.
