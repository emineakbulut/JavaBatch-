Inheritance: is a mechanism in Java through which we ca use the fields and methods from
one class to other class without rewriting/repeating the code from the class
from which we are inheriting.
process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another
Inheriting properties from parent class such as instance variables and methods

BENEFITS:
-cleaner and more efficient code for memory and execution;
-it helps us reduce duplicate code;
-it saves time, cause we have to write less code;
-reusing the same code again
DISADVANTAGES:
-classes are coupled;
-if we make changes in one class they will happen in another;
e.g
Class Parent{
int Money;
void print(){
sout ("Money="+Mney)
}
}
class Child extends Parent{
main method(){
Child child=new Child();
child.print();
}
}
we can access our static fields and methods using class names and using objects
of the class bu using Class name is preferable because static methods and fields
belong to class not to objects.
SuperKeyword:
As we can use this keyword in java to refer to the current fields and methods we can use super
keyword to access the fields and methods from immediate parent class.
it is used in subclasses to access superclass members
in inheritance when we create an object
of a class all of the default constructors from p
